# ManaTTS-Persian-Tacotron2-Model

This repository introduces a Persian Text-to-Speech (TTS) model trained on the [**ManaTTS dataset**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MahtaFetrat/Mana-TTS), the largest publicly accessible single-speaker Persian corpus. The dataset comprises over 100 hours of high-quality audio (44.1 kHz) sourced from the [**Nasl-e-Mana magazine**](https://naslemana.com/). The model is based on the [Tacotron2 architecture](https://github.com/MahtaFetrat/Persian-MultiSpeaker-Tacotron2/) and is designed to generate natural and high-quality Persian speech.

**Model Weights**: The trained model weights are hosted on Hugging Face. You can access them here: [Persian-Tacotron2-on-ManaTTS](https://huggingface.co/MahtaFetrat/Persian-Tacotron2-on-ManaTTS).

### Output Samples

You can find output samples synthesized by the trained model in [this directory](https://github.com/MahtaFetrat/ManaTTS-Persian-Tacotron2-Model/tree/master/output_samples) along with the same utterances generated by two baseline models, the natural utterances, and utterances with gold spectrograms where the waveform is generated by the vocoder used in the study.
